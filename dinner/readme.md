Baked Mac and Cheese

## Servings: 2

## Time to prepare: 30 min

## Ingredients: 
Elbow macaroni, cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, parsley


## Equipment needed:
Bowl, pan, colander, wooden spooken, measuring cups

## Steps for preparation:
1. Cook elbow macaroni on stove top
2. Heat cheese on pan
3. Mix the cheese and macaroni and season

### Notes:
Make sure to let the bread crumbs get nice and toasted!
Check the pasta after about 9 minutes for most elbow pasta, you want it to be al dente, with just a bit of resistance when you bite through but with no hint of graininess.
Don't start heating the cheese too early, you don't want it to burn before the pasta is ready and you don't want to have to let it cool and then re-heat it. 
For the seasoning, if you want to make it spicy you can use a little Cayenne pepper.
